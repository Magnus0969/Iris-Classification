# Iris Species Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying Iris species based on their features. The project utilizes logistic regression to build and evaluate a model for accurate classification.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the Iris dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the structure and features of the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building**: Implement and train a logistic regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy as the metric.
5. **Model Saving**: Save the trained model using `pickle` for future use.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- pickle

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
